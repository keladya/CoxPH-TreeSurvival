# Tree Survival Analysis Using Cox Proportional Hazards Model

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Cox Proportional Hazards model to analyze tree survival rates. The study focuses on various environmental and biological factors such as species type, light exposure, and soil sterilization, and how these influence the longevity and survival rates of trees.

## Data Source
The dataset, titled "Tree Survival Prediction," is utilized for this analysis and is sourced from Kaggle. It includes comprehensive measurements of 2783 trees, capturing a range of environmental and biological variables. Access the dataset directly through this link: [Kaggle: Tree Survival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yekenot/tree-survival-prediction).

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, selecting relevant variables, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performing statistical summaries and creating visualizations to understand the data better.
- **Survival Analysis:** Building the Cox Proportional Hazards model to determine the impact of various factors on tree survival.
- **Statistical Testing:** Using tests like the log-rank test to evaluate differences in survival across different groups defined by our variables.
